# Jarbas

Jarbas is a multimodal Windows controller app, made for the IM (Interação Multimodal) course of MIECT, at DETI-UA (University of Aveiro). The name and purpose of this project is based on Iron Man' movie Jarvis.

In this project we used Microsoft Speech for voice recognition and text-to-speech feedback, as well as Kinect to record and recognize the gestures we use.

This work was split into 3 stages: one purely relying on voice commands, other relying on gestures, and the final work using Fusion Framework from IEETA, combining both voice and gestures on the app.
